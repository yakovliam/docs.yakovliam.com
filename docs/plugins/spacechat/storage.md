# Storage

Here you can edit the storage type for logs, and other data that the plugin might need to store.

Types
-
There are currently two types of storage mediums, `mysql` and `json`.

Setting Up
-
Simply fill out the fields in the [Configuration](plugins/spacechat/configandpermissions.md), and either start your server or reload the plugin using the [Reload Command](plugins/spacechat/commands.md).

Example
-
The default storage configuration is embedded into the normal configuration. Therefore, it is located at the [Configuration Section](plugins/spacechat/configandpermissions.md).
